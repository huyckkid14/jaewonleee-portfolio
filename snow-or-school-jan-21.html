<p>Talk across the school has students saying that Tuesday, Jan. 21 will be a “cold day.” According to a recent survey of seven Clague eighth grade students, all of them expected a cold day on Tuesday. But is this rumor true?</p>

<p>According to AccuWeather, Tuesday has a probability of precipitation of only 20 percent, but its high temperature would only reach negative 15 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit). In other words, it is rare that it would snow on Tuesday, but it will be too cold to go outside, making it dangerous or even impossible for school to proceed.</p>

<p>Subsequently, some students also say that Wednesday will be a snow day (or cold day) too. Unfortunately, this might not be the best time for a cold day since semester one is ending the following Friday, Jan. 24. If a snow day occurs right before the end of a quarter or semester, the quarter would likely be extended.</p>

<p>However, it is also important to not be carried away when discussing snow or cold days. Under Michigan law, Ann Arbor Public Schools (AAPS) is required to have make-up days if there are more than six snow days, known as forgiveness days. As a result, AAPS has to fill out a waiver form to ask for an exception, which may or may not be accepted. AAPS waivers have never been declined, but the government declining the next waiver is always possible.</p>

<p>While it looks like Tuesday, Jan. 21 may be a cold day, we must understand the consequences — good or bad — of snow days. To find out if Tuesday will be a snow day, listen for calls, texts, and emails from AAPS announcing that it is a snow day. Don’t be disappointed if you don’t get a notice on Monday night — the notification can be as late as 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday.</p>
