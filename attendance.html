    I chose this article because it showcases a variety of AI uses in one of the most revered universities in Michigan. This topic is important because it explains about a new change at a college that many Huron students will probably go to. It shows how journalism can inform the community even if it is not informational for certain.
  </p>

  <p>
    This piece demonstrates my ability to interview people, as I was able to get a few quotes from a very high-ranking person in the university. It also shows my strength in organization. I made sure the article was clear and informative for my audience.
  </p>

  <p>
    One challenge I faced was organizing all the quotes I had for the article. I overcame this by dumping everything out and rearranging it bit by bit. This helped make the organization more interesting and natural.

<div class="article">

<p>Huron administrators set a new attendance policy on Dec. 1, 2025. The new rule now accounts for specific disciplinary action for certain amounts of tardies or absences.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter is always talking about how much attendance matters,” Huron freshman Sydney Anton said. “And it really does.”</p>

<p>However, despite Carter’s words, about 60 students every week show up tardy for class. That is why the new policy was implemented.</p>

<p>Students who accumulate at least five tardies or unverified absences in one week will receive escalating discipline: lunch detention for the first offense, after-school detention for the second, an attendance contract and a parent meeting for the third, and suspension for the fourth. These incidents will notify parents as well as being recorded on PowerSchool.</p>

<p>According to Lorri English, the ninth grade Dean at Huron, the attendance policy was revised “to address growing concerns about attendance and truancy and to ensure consistency and fairness.”</p>

<p>Students who exceed the attendance thresholds will also face temporary restrictions on extracurricular activities like sports and clubs. Subsequently, students who keep a perfect attendance record for a week will receive benefits such as but not limited to complimentary Homecoming, athletic, and school event tickets, front-of-the-line access to the lunch line, and gift cards from local businesses.</p>

<p>“I feel like the new attendance policy makes sense,” Anton said. “Five tardies in a week and five unverified absences seems like a good limit before action is required.”</p>

<p>The attendance policy seems to have a positive incentive on students as well.</p>

<p>“This is our first week enforcing the policy so there is no data yet,” English said. “However, we have great data from utilizing a form of restricted passes during football season.”</p>

<p>Administrators encouraged students to be on time to class, and families were asked to review expectations with their students and contact counselors if attendance barriers arise.</p>
