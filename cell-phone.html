  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>I chose this article because it focuses on the new cell phone policy at Huron High School. This topic is important because it explains about a new change at the school. It shows how journalism can inform about new changes and policies to the community.</p>
  <p>This piece demonstrates my ability to create a news piece under tight deadlines (I was asked to do this last-minute). It also shows my strength in interviewing people. I made sure the article was informative for my audience.</p>
  <p>One challenge I faced was writing this under a tight deadline. I overcame this by doing interviews as soon as possible. This helped make the article stronger.</p>

<div class="article">

<p>Huron High School introduced a new change this year – a cell phone pocket policy. This new policy mandates all students to turn in their devices to a pocket holder in the classroom, usually near the door of the classroom.</p>

<p>The goal of the new policy is to make sure students are more focused on schoolwork rather than their cell phones.</p>

<p>“I am a huge fan of the new cell phone policy,” English teacher Daniel Crowley said.“In past years, I allowed students to keep their phones in their pockets, believing that doing so would encourage them to learn to self-monitor, and to eventually be able to become wholly responsible for their use of technology. The number of students who come to class exhausted because they spent all night on their phones has dramatically increased since I began teaching, but what’s more, I’m struck by the legions of Ann Arborites who seem glued to their phones.”</p>

<p>Crowley said the new policy is a “great step” in the direction of making students more focused.</p>

<p>“[The policy is] urging students to slow down and experience learning as teachers have been trained to deliver it, rather than insisting teachers adapt their instruction to another paradigm shift,” Crowley said.</p>

<p>Junior Keunhyung Cho thought that he didn’t like the cell phone pocket policy. “for the obvious reason” (which is that students cannot use the phone during classes).</p>

<p>However, Cho also said that the cell phone policy wasn’t fully horrible.</p>

<p>“[I am also] positive on this policy because it lets us focus deeper and be productive,” Cho said. “I think we should continue this policy.”</p>

<p>The administration hopes that the new policy will help students balance both their screen time and engagement during class.</p>

<p>“We want students to be fully present in their learning,” Huron assistant principal Claire Federhofer said. “This policy is about finding a healthy balance, using technology as a tool when it supports instruction, while also creating space for deeper concentration, collaboration, and engagement in class.”</p>
