00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
Clague Middle School is excited to welcome Ryan Soupal as its

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
new Assistant Principal. With 23 years of experience in education,

00:22.000 --> 00:30.000
Soupal brings a wealth of knowledge and a passion for working with diverse students and staff.

00:30.000 --> 00:43.000
"My name is Ryan Soupal. I am originally from Troy, Michigan,
and I have been in education for 23 years."

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
Soupal's career in education is marked by a commitment to fostering student growth

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
and supporting educational communities. His experience includes various leadership roles,

00:55.000 --> 01:04.000
which he believes have prepared him for this position at Clague.

01:04.000 --> 01:13.000
"I think getting to work with such a diverse group of students and staff
excites me the most. It gives you the ability to learn about lots

01:13.000 --> 01:25.000
of different people and work with really great students and staff here at Clague."

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
His enthusiasm for diversity reflects the core values of Clague Middle School,

01:30.000 --> 01:41.000
where different backgrounds and perspectives contribute to a rich learning environment. Mr.
Soupal views this diversity as an opportunity not only to support students but also to learn
from them and the staff members who bring unique experiences to the table.

01:49.000 --> 01:58.000
"I aim to continue to serve in this role and serve this community,
and to become the biggest supporter of the Clague Cougars."

01:58.000 --> 02:15.000
Soupal’s dedication to the Clague community is evident in his intention to be a visible
leader. He recognizes the importance of building strong relationships with students,
staff, and parents to create a supportive educational environment.

02:24.000 --> 02:36.000
Contrary to student belief, Soupal did not actually teach at Scarlett
Middle School. He clarified his role there:

02:36.000 --> 02:51.000
"I actually didn't teach at Scarlett. I worked as the International Baccalaureate coordinator,
helping Scarlett become an authorized International Baccalaureate World School. I
also helped all of the teachers learn how to teach in an International Baccalaureate World School."

03:00.000 --> 03:08.000
Soupal stated that the main reason he applied for Assistant Principal was

03:08.000 --> 03:20.000
because he has always accepted leadership roles throughout his educational journey,

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
as he explained in the interview:

03:25.000 --> 03:38.000
"Throughout my entire teaching career, I've always accepted
leadership roles as they come around, and I felt like becoming the Assistant
Principal of Clague was the next step in my educational and professional journey."

03:46.000 --> 03:57.000
His drive for professional growth is a testament to his commitment to
education and his desire to take on greater responsibilities. Soupal’s journey reflects a
continuous pursuit of excellence, not just for himself but for the entire school community.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
"Getting to meet all of the great students
and staff here is my favorite part. I've met so many wonderful people,

04:12.000 --> 04:21.000
and I look forward to continuing to meet more and more of the staff and students here."

04:21.000 --> 04:41.000
With his dedication and extensive experience, Clague Middle School anticipates positive
developments under Soupal's leadership as Assistant Principal. His commitment to fostering
an inclusive and supportive environment promises to enhance the educational experience for all.
